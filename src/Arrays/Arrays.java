ARRAY'S
    Array's in Java are also objects.
    They need to be declared and then created.
    In order to declare a variable that will hold an array of integers, we use the following syntax:

        int[] arr;

    Notice there is no size, since we didn't create the array yet.

        arr = new int[10];

    This will create a new array with the size of 10. We can check the size by printing the array's length:

        System.out.println(arr.length);

    We can access the array and set values:

        arr[0] = 4;
        arr[1] = arr[0] + 5;

    Java arrays are 0 based, which means the first element in an array is accessed at index 0 (e.g: arr[0], which accesses the first element).
    Also, as an example, an array of size 5 will only go up to index 4 due to it being 0 based.

        int[] arr = new int[5];

        //accesses and sets the first element
        arr[0] = 4;

    We can also create an array with values in the same line:

        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    NOTE: Don't try to print the array without a loop, it will print something nasty like [I@f7e6a96.
          To print out an array, use the following code:

        for (int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i]);
        }

    Exercise
    Change the values in numbers, so it will not raise an error.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        int length = numbers[3];
        char[] chars = new char[length];
        chars[numbers.length + 4] = 'y';
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }
*/
public class Arrays {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
        int length = numbers[2];
        char[] chars = new char[length];
        chars[numbers.length - 1] = 'y';
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }
}
