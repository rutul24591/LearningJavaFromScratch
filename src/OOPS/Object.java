/*
* OBJECTS
    Everything in Java is within classes and objects.
    Java objects hold a state, state are variables which are saved together within an object,
    we call them fields or member variables.

    Let start with an example:

    class Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    }
    This class defined a point with x and y values.

    In order to create an instance of this class, we need to use the keyword new.

    Point p = new Point();

    In this case, we used a default constructor (constructor that doesn't get arguments) to create a Point.
    All classes that don't explicitly define a constructor has a default constructor that does nothing.

    We can define our own constructor:

    class Point {
        int x;
        int y;

        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }
    This means we can no longer use the default constructor new Point(). We can now only use the defined constructor new Point(4, 1).

    We can define more than one constructor, so Point can be created in several ways. Let's define the default constructor again.

    class Point {
        int x;
        int y;

        Point() {
            this(0, 0);
        }

        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }
    Notice the usage of the `this` keyword here. We can use it within a constructor to call a different constructor (in order to avoid code duplication).
    It can only be the first line within the constructor.

    We also used the `this` keyword as a reference of the current object we are running on.

    After we defined p we can access x and y.

    p.x = 3;
    p.y = 6;
    Methods
    We can now define methods on Point.

    class Point {
        ... // Our code previously
        void printPoint() {
            System.out.println("(" + x + "," + y + ")");
        }

        Point center(Point other) {
            // Returns the center between this point the other point
            // Notice we are using integer, we won't get an accurate value
            return new Point((x + other.x) / 2, (y + other.y) / 2);
        }
    }

    In Java, objects are an instance of a Java Class.

    PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEYWORDS

    When using the keyword private before a variable or a method, it means only the class itself can access the variable or method,
    when we're using public it means everybody can access it.
    We usually see constructors defined as public, variables defined as private and methods are separated, some public and some private.

    EXERCISE
    Write a new method in Point called scale, that will make the point closer by half to (0,0). So for example, point (8, 4) after scale will be (4, 2).

         class Point {
            private double x;
            private double y;

            public Point(double x, double y) {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
            }

            public void print() {
                System.out.println("(" + x + "," + y + ")");
            }

            // Your code goes here
            public void scale(){
                x = x/2;
                y = y/2;
            }
        }

        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Point p = new Point(32, 32);
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    p.scale();
                    p.print();
                }
            }
        }
